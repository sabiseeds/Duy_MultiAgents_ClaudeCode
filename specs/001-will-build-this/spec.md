## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

As a user, I want to submit complex tasks in natural language and have them automatically broken down and executed in parallel by specialized AI agents, so that I can accomplish multi-step workflows efficiently without manual coordination.

**Main Journey:**
1. User accesses a web-based control center
2. User enters a task description (e.g., "Analyze sales data from database, generate visualizations, and create a summary report")
3. System automatically decomposes the task into subtasks
4. System assigns subtasks to specialized agents based on required capabilities
5. User monitors real-time progress through a dashboard
6. System aggregates results when all subtasks complete
7. User reviews final consolidated output

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user has accessed the control center, **When** they submit a task "Scrape product prices from website and store in database", **Then** the system breaks it into subtasks (web scraping, data validation, database insertion) and executes them in the correct order

2. **Given** multiple subtasks are ready to execute, **When** agents become available, **Then** the system executes independent subtasks in parallel to minimize total execution time

3. **Given** a subtask depends on results from previous subtasks, **When** the dependent subtask is assigned, **Then** the agent receives context from all prerequisite subtasks

4. **Given** a task is executing across multiple agents, **When** the user views the dashboard, **Then** they see real-time status of each subtask, which agents are working, and completion percentage

5. **Given** an agent fails to complete a subtask, **When** the failure is detected, **Then** the system marks the subtask as failed, logs the error, and prevents dependent subtasks from executing

6. **Given** all subtasks for a task have completed, **When** the system aggregates results, **Then** the final output combines all subtask outputs in a structured format with a summary

### Edge Cases

- What happens when no agents have the required capabilities for a subtask?
  - System must queue the subtask and wait, or report that the task cannot be completed with available agents

- How does the system handle subtasks that exceed timeout limits?
  - System must mark subtask as failed after timeout, log execution time, and allow retry or cancellation

- What happens when multiple users submit tasks simultaneously?
  - System must queue tasks fairly and distribute agent capacity across all active tasks

- How does the system handle agents that become unavailable during execution?
  - System must detect agent failure via heartbeat mechanism and reassign in-progress subtasks to other capable agents

- What happens when subtask results are too large for memory?
  - System must support file-based result storage with references rather than inline data

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Task Management:**
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept natural language task descriptions from users through a web interface
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically decompose tasks into granular subtasks with clear descriptions
- **FR-003**: System MUST identify dependencies between subtasks to determine execution order
- **FR-004**: System MUST assign priority levels to subtasks (0-10 scale)
- **FR-005**: System MUST estimate execution duration for each subtask
- **FR-006**: System MUST persist all task data including status, timestamps, and results

**Agent Coordination:**
- **FR-007**: System MUST support at least 5 concurrent specialized agents with different capability sets
- **FR-008**: System MUST assign subtasks to agents based on required capabilities (data analysis, web scraping, code generation, file processing, database operations, API integration)
- **FR-009**: System MUST track agent availability and prevent overallocation
- **FR-010**: System MUST execute independent subtasks in parallel when agents are available
- **FR-011**: System MUST ensure dependent subtasks execute only after all prerequisites complete successfully
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide agents with context from prerequisite subtask results

**Resource Sharing:**
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide agents with shared access to a persistent data store for reading and writing data
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide agents with shared file storage for intermediate and final outputs
- **FR-015**: System MUST enable agents to share state and communicate results through a queuing mechanism
- **FR-016**: System MUST prevent race conditions and conflicts when multiple agents access shared resources

**Monitoring & Observability:**
- **FR-017**: System MUST display real-time task status showing pending, in-progress, completed, and failed subtasks
- **FR-018**: System MUST show which agents are currently working on which subtasks
- **FR-019**: System MUST display agent health status including availability, CPU usage, memory usage, and task completion count
- **FR-020**: System MUST log all agent activity including task assignments, execution progress, and errors
- **FR-021**: System MUST provide execution time metrics for each subtask and overall task
- **FR-022**: System MUST allow users to view detailed logs for troubleshooting

**Error Handling:**
- **FR-023**: System MUST detect and report subtask failures with specific error messages
- **FR-024**: System MUST mark all dependent subtasks as blocked when a prerequisite fails
- **FR-025**: System MUST detect unresponsive agents through periodic heartbeat checks and mark them as unavailable

### Key Entities

- **Task**: User-submitted work request containing description, unique identifier, submission timestamp, current status, list of subtasks, aggregated results, and error information

- **SubTask**: Individual unit of work containing unique identifier, description, list of required capabilities, list of prerequisite subtask IDs, priority level, estimated duration, input data, and assigned agent

- **Agent**: Independent execution unit containing unique identifier, network endpoint, availability status, list of capabilities, current subtask assignment, resource usage metrics, and task completion count

- **SubTaskResult**: Output from subtask execution containing parent task ID, subtask ID, executing agent ID, completion status, output data, error information, execution time, and completion timestamp

- **AgentCapability**: Categorization of agent specialization including data analysis, web scraping, code generation, file processing, database operations, and API integration

- **TaskQueue**: Ordered collection of subtasks awaiting execution, prioritized by dependency order and priority level

- **SharedState**: Key-value storage enabling agents to exchange data and coordinate during task execution
